### Week 1: Initializing the Expo Project and Basic Functionalities

This week, I initialized the Expo project and added some basic functionalities to get the application up and running. This included setting up the basic file structure, which is crucial for organizing the codebase effectively and ensuring scalability. I also added photo display capabilities, allowing the app to render images, which is essential for a visually-driven application like a music streaming service. Furthermore, I implemented a tab-based navigation system to provide a simple and intuitive way for users to move between different sections of the app. Finally, I made sure that all the initial dependencies were properly configured to avoid any potential conflicts or issues down the line.

### Week 2: Spotify Log In and Sign Up

This week, I focused on implementing user authentication to allow users to sign up and log in to the application. I created the sign-up and log-in screens, which are the entry points for users to access the app's features. To handle user data, I integrated AsyncStorage for basic data persistence, which stores user credentials locally on the device. This allows users to remain logged in between sessions, providing a more seamless user experience. I also added error handling to provide feedback to the user in case of incorrect credentials or other issues during the authentication process.

### Week 3: Transitions and Effects

This week, I dedicated my efforts to improving the user experience by adding transitions and effects throughout the application. I implemented screen transitions to make the navigation between different screens feel smoother and more polished, which contributes to a more professional look and feel. Additionally, I added some subtle effects to various UI elements to provide visual feedback and make the app more engaging for the user. These effects were carefully chosen to be non-intrusive and to enhance the overall aesthetic of the application without being distracting. The goal was to create a more dynamic and interactive experience for the user.

### Week 4: Playlist Builder and Profile Creation

This week, I focused on adding two major features to the application: a playlist builder and profile creation. The playlist builder allows users to create their own custom playlists, giving them the ability to curate their music collection according to their personal preferences. The profile creation feature enables users to create and customize their own user profiles, which is a key aspect of social and personalized applications. This feature also lays the groundwork for future social features, such as sharing playlists or following other users. I also made sure that the data for both playlists and profiles is stored correctly and can be retrieved when needed.

### Week 5: Theme Switcher

This week, I implemented a theme switcher, which allows users to choose between a light and a dark theme. This feature enhances the user's ability to personalize their experience and can also help to reduce eye strain in low-light environments. The theme switcher is implemented using React's Context API to manage the theme state globally throughout the application. This ensures that all components are updated correctly when the user switches themes, providing a consistent user experience. I also made sure to design both the light and dark themes to be visually appealing and to maintain the overall aesthetic of the application.
